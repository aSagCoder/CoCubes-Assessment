# Work Left

Work = Force * Displacement

Implement the following function - 

def WorkLeft(f1, d1, f2, d2):

The function accepts positive integers 'work' that needs to be done, f1 and f2 are the forces applied by 1st and 2nd person respectively and d1 and d2 are the displacements done by the force application by 1st and 2nd person respectively. Implement the function to find and return the work left after the two people completed their work. 

Assumption - work > ((f1 x d1) + (f2 x d2))

Note - computed value lies within the positive integer range
