# Truck Distance

You are given a function, 

int Distance (int Ax, int Ay, int Bx, int, By): 

The function accepts the coordinates of truck A(Ax, Ay) and the coordinates of B(Bx, By) as input. The office is at location (0,0). Implement the function to determine which truck is square of distance between two points having coordinates (x,y) and (0,0): 

(Distance)^2 = [x^2 + y^2] 

Note - 
No need to compute the square root of the distance of trucks A and B from office. 
If both trucks are at equal distance, return square of distance of either truck
